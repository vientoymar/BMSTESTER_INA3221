# BMSTESTER_INA3221
Using two INA3221 to test balance of a 4S BMS

With the Beastdevices library, I found how to manage to similar I2C devices (INA3221) changing the address of each one soldering the jumpers.

I couldn't find many info about how to program it without a multiplexor. 

All is explained in the code. I hope it's enought.
