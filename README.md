Using two INA3221 to test balance of a 4S BMS

With the Beastdevices library, I found how to manage two similar I2C devices (INA3221) changing the address of each one soldering the jumpers.

I couldn't find many info about how to program it without a multiplexor. 

All is explained in the code. I hope it's enought. 

Hardware used:

1ea- ESP32-WROOM-U
2eas- INA3221
1ea - OLED SCREEN 0.96 IN
